#RAML documentation of the API:

The file `rpi-rest-leds.raml` has the RAML representation of the API.

For a more human-readable documentation in Markdown, look at `rpi-rest-leds.md`, which was partially generated by [ramltomd](https://github.com/diegogurgel/ramltomd) and edited by hand afterwards.
